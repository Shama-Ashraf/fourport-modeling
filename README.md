## üß† Project Overview

This project is based on a conceptual problem from a machine learning textbook. The goal is to analyze an unknown "black box" four-port electronic system. By applying current (`I`) as input and measuring voltage (`V`) as output, we use **Linear Regression** to learn the system's behavior and reveal its simple, elegant underlying principle: **Ohm's Law**.

---

## ‚ùì The Problem

We are presented with an unknown system (`H(Œ∏)`):

The internal parameters (`Œ∏`) of the process are hidden. The task is to build a digital model that can describe, diagnose, predict, and prescribe actions for this system.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è The Solution

1.  **Data Collection:** Multiple input currents (`I`) were applied, and corresponding output voltages (`V`) were measured.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** A scatter plot of `I` vs. `V` revealed a strong, linear relationship.
3.  **Model Selection:** A **Linear Regression** model (without an intercept) was chosen, hypothesizing the relationship `V = k * I`.
4.  **Model Training:** The model was trained on the collected data using `scikit-learn`.
5.  **Evaluation & Insight:** The model's coefficient was extracted, revealing the system's parameter.

---

## üìä Key Results

The trained model successfully uncovered the physical law governing the system:

### **Model Equation:**
\[ V = 4.96 \cdot I \]

### **Physical Equivalent:**
The unknown system behaves exactly like a **resistor** with a resistance of **~5 Œ©**.
This confirms that the process follows **Ohm's Law**: \( V = I \cdot R \).

## üìà Types of Analytics
This model can be used for all four types of data analytics:

üìã **Descriptive:** What happened? "The output was 25V because the input was 5A."

üîç **Diagnostic:** Why did it happen? "The high output is expected behavior, not a system error."

üîÆ **Predictive:** What will happen? "If input reaches 4A, output will be ~20V."

üéØ **Prescriptive:** What should we do? "Keep input current below 4A to ensure output voltage stays under 20V."
